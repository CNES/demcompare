Welcome to DEMCOMPARE's documentation!
======================================


**Demcompare is a python software for DEMs comparison.**

Overview
########

DEMcompare is a python software that aims at **comparing two DEMs** together.

A DEM is a 3D computer graphics representation of elevation data to represent terrain.
DEMcompare has several characteristics:

- Provides a wide variety of standard metrics and allows one to classify the statistics.
- Works whether or not the two DEMs share common format, projection system,
- Planimetric resolution, and altimetric unit.
- The coregistration algorithm is based on the [NuthKaab]_ universal coregistration method.
- The default behavior classifies the stats by slope ranges but one can provide any other data to classify the stats.

A comparison report can be compiled as *html* or *pdf* documentation with statistics printed as tables and plots.
