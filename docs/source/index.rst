Welcome to demcompare's documentation!
======================================

**Demcompare** is a python software that aims at **comparing two DEMs** together.

A :term:`DEM` is a 3D computer graphics representation of elevation data to represent terrain.
demcompare has several characteristics:

- Provides a wide variety of standard metrics and allows one to classify the statistics.
- Works whether or not the two DEMs share common format projection system, planimetric resolution, and altimetric unit.
- Performs the coregistration based on the Nuth & Kääb universal coregistration method.
- Classifies the stats by slope ranges by default, but one can provide any other data to classify the stats.

A comparison report can be compiled as *html* or *pdf* documentation with statistics printed as tables and plots.
