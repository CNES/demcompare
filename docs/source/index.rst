Welcome to demcompare documentation!
====================================

**Demcompare** is a python software that aims at **comparing two DEMs** together.

Demcompare has several benefits:

- Works whether or not the two DEMs share common format projection system, planimetric resolution, and altimetric unit.
- Performs the coregistration based on the Nuth & Kääb universal coregistration method.
- Computes the statistics on an input DEM, or on the difference of two input DEMs.
- Provides a wide variety of standard metrics and allows one to classify the DEMs to obtain statistics by class.

A comparison report can be compiled as *html* or *pdf* documentation with statistics printed as tables and plots.
